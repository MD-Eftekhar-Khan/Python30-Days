# 1. What is Python, why and how to setup the environment?
# 2. First python program run and Explanation step by step.
# 3. Python Comments: single &  multi-line or (Block) comments
# 4. Python Variable: rules & usages

#3. In python single & multi-line or block comment syntax are same.
#This is a single line comment 
#This is a multi-line or block comment

# 4. Python Variable: rules & usages

#4.1. No explicit declaration needed
    # i. A variable is created when you assign a value with =
    # ii. Example:
# x = 10
# name = "Alice"

#4.2. Naming Rules

   # i. Variable can contain letters(A-Z), (a-z), digit(0-9), Underscore(_)
   # ii. Can't start with digit
   # ✅ age1 = 25
   # ❌ 1age = 25

#4.3. Dynamic Typing
   #i. Python infers the type from the value assigned.
# x = 5         int
# x = "hello"   now str

#4.4. Reassignment allowed:
    #.i. You can change the value or even the type of a variable at any time.

#4.5. Special characters not allowed:
    #i. Only _ is permitted. No spaces, hyphens, or symbols.

# ❌ user-name = "Tom"
# ✅ user_name = "Tom"

#4.6. Convention (not enforced, but recommended):
    # i. Use snake_case for variable names: total_price, user_age.
    # ii. Constants are written in UPPERCASE: PI = 3.14159.
